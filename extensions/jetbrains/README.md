# JetBrains Toolbox Search Recent Projects

This extension should work out of the box. If you have multiple JetBrains apps installed, you can choose a priority app to bump to the top of the list in preferences.

##Issues opening projects?

Things to check:

 1. Have you enabled the shell scripts in JetBrains Toolbox preferences?
 2. Have you set a custom path to your shell scripts? Add that to the extension preferences
 3. By default fallback to protocol url is disabled, if you really don't want to enable the shell scripts, enable the fallback to use the unreliable url method of opening projects.
